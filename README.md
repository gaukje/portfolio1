    Import necessary libraries:
    The code imports the required libraries for sockets, threading, argparse (for command-line argument parsing), and the time module.

    Utility functions:
        parse_num_bytes: Parses a string representing a number of bytes, and returns the corresponding integer value (e.g., "10M" -> 10,000,000).
        format_summary_line: Formats the data for printing as a table row by adjusting the column widths.

    Server functions:
        server: The main function for server mode. It creates a socket, binds it to the given IP and port, and listens for incoming connections. When a client connects, it starts a new thread to handle that client using the handle_client function.
        handle_client: This function is the target for each client-handling thread. It receives data from the client, tracks the received bytes, and calculates the time elapsed. When the client sends the "BYE" message, it sends an acknowledgment and closes the connection. Finally, it prints a summary of the received data and bandwidth.

    Client functions:
        client: The main function for client mode. It creates and starts multiple threads (parallel number of threads) that will send data to the server. After starting all the threads, it waits for them to finish using t.join().
        client_worker: The target function for each thread created in the client function. It establishes a connection with the server, sends data in chunks of 1000 bytes, and tracks the sent bytes and time elapsed. It also handles the intervals by calling the print_interval function when the specified interval has passed. At the end, it sends a "BYE" message to the server to signal the end of the connection, and then prints the final summary using print_interval.
        print_interval: This function prints the statistics for each interval. It calculates the time elapsed since the start time, the interval start, and the sent megabytes and bandwidth for the interval. It then prints the interval statistics in the desired format. If the summary flag is True, it prints a separator line instead of the table headers.

    Argument parsing and main code execution:
        The code defines an argparse.ArgumentParser instance to handle command-line arguments, with options for server and client modes, IP addresses, port numbers, time intervals, number of bytes to send, and parallel connections.
        Based on the parsed arguments, the code either starts the server mode with the server function or the client mode with the client function.

This code provides a simple tool for measuring network performance by sending data between a client and a server, with options for specifying the number of bytes to send, the interval to print statistics, and the number of parallel connections.
